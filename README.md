# Wheel-of-Fortune Clone

This is a small wheel of fortune style game coded completely from scratch. The game board and spin animation were coded using a modular SASS style. The javascript algorithms were all created by me from scratch to position the words on the game board and to spin the wheel a random number of rotations between 1 and 2.

The purpose of this app was to demonstrate how far my skills in writing modular sass and javascript object oriented style as well as constructing my own algorithms.
